    <h3>Crispy Pork Gyoza or Pan Fried Dumplings</h3>
    <p> <strong>Gyoza</strong> is a dumpling typically filled with meat, vegetables, and seasonings that are wrapped in a thin dough. The dish originates from China but is eaten all across the world.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Pork</li>
        <li>Potherbs: green onions, ginger, garlic chives, and garlic.</li>
        <li>Condiments/Seasonings: salt, pepper, sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce.</li>
        <li>Lard or Cooking Oil</li>
        <li>Gyoza Wrappers</li>
        <li>Dipping sauce of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Finely cut the green onion , garlic, and ginger</strong> In this recipe, I focus on a meaty and flavourful gyoza. The vegetables are minimal! The main vegetable is green onion. Vegetables for gyoza fillings should always be finely diced.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the filling</strong> First, add the pork mince, spring onion, garlic, ginger, and condiments to a large mixing bowl. Gently knead them together until evenly distributed. Try not to knead it too much, as this will cause it to become too smooth and meatball-like, we want to keep as much texture as possible!</li>
        <li><strong>Add warm water</strong> You might be surprised about this step, but adding warm water to the filling will make it extra juicy! Usually, you would rely on the vegetable liquid to make the filling more juicy, but not in this case! Add the warm water one-third at a time and mix it by hand. </li>
        <li><strong>Add lard and garlic chives</strong> Finally, add the lard (and/or sesame oil) and chives. I added these last so that they don't get over-mixed. Give the filling a final knead, and now you're ready to shape!</li>
        <li><strong>Shaping the gyoza</strong> Add about 1 tablespoon of filling to the center of the wrapper, leaving a thick border around the edge. This border is necessary to seal the gyoza. It's very important not to overfill the wrapper. If you put too much filling, the wrapper could tear or not close properly. If there are holes, the juices leak into the pan and ruin the finish. Next, dab the top half edge with water. This will act as a “glue” to seal the gyoza shut. Keep a small bowl of water nearby for convenience. Pinch one side of the wetted edge to start shaping. If you're right-handed, this will probably be on the right side and vice versa. To pleat the top, make a small flap on the edge of the top half and push it toward the pinched corner. Press it down and make small pleats until the gyoza is closed. Press it firmly along the edge to seal it securely. You can also flatten the base by tapping it on the counter or the palm of your hand a few times. This is important for crisping up the bottom when it's frying! </li>
        <li><strong>Cooking the gyoza</strong> Preheat your pan to medium and add a generous amount of oil. Spread the oil evenly over the pan to ensure the gyoza doesn't stick or tear. Fill the pan with as many gyoza that will fit in one layer. It's okay if they're close together, but make sure the bottom of the gyoza is fully in contact with the pan's surface (otherwise, it won't get crispy!) If possible, try and leave a tiny bit of space between them so the wrappers don't stick together. Check the underneath occasionally to see when they start to change color. Once all the gyoza have a golden base, pour in a thin slurry made with 1/2 tsp of flour mixed with 50ml (approx 3 tbsp) of cold water. Place a lid on top and allow them to steam for a few minutes. (Approximately 4-5 minutes from chilled, a few minutes longer from frozen.) Typically, you can add boiling water to the pan for steaming (about 80ml per 10 pieces); however, I love to make my gyoza extra crispy with a slurry mixture. We call this type of gyoza, “hanetsuki gyoza” (羽付き餃子) which means “gyoza with wings”. Wings of crispy deliciousness! Be careful not to add too much flour to the slurry; otherwise, it can become gummy or sticky</li>
        <li><strong>Dishing up</strong> Once you start to hear crackling or notice the flour at the bottom start to change color, remove the lid and allow the steam to evaporate. Finally, add a drizzle of sesame oil over the top and flip the cooked gyoza onto a plate. </li>
    </ol>
