    <h3>A cozy Bacon filled Potato Soup</h3>
    <p><strong>Potato Soup</strong> Is a nice filling and super yummy dish that will make you think of a brisk winter evening with family.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>6 strips (uncooked) bacon</strong> cut into small pieces</li>
        <li><strong>3 Tablespoons butter</strong> unsalted or salted will do</li>
        <li><strong>1 medium yellow onion</strong> chopped about 1.5 cups/200mg</li>
        <li><strong>3 large garlic cloves</strong> minced</li>
        <li><strong>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</strong> (42g)</li>
        <li><strong>2 ½ lbs gold potatoes</strong> peeled and dinced into pieces no larger than 1"</li>
        <li><strong>4 cups chicken broth</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 cups milk</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2/3 cup heavy cream</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 teaspoon ground pepper</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1/4-1/2 teaspoon ancho chili powder</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2/3 cup sour cream</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Shredded cheddar cheese, chives, and additional sour cream and bacon for topping</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon pieces in a large Dutch Oven or soup pot over medium heat and cook until bacon is crisp and browned.</li>
        <li>Remove bacon pieces and set aside, leaving the fat in the pot.</li>
        <li>Add butter and chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onions are tender (3-5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the flour over the ingredients in the pot and stir until smooth (use whisk if needed).</li>
        <li>Add diced potatoes to the pot along with chicken broth, milk, heavy cream, salt, pepper, and ancho chili powder. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork (about 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to simmer and remove approximately half*** of the soup to a blender (be careful, it will be hot!) and puree until smooth (half is about 5 cups of soup, but just eyeballing the amount will be fine. Alternatively you can use an immersion blender.).</li>
        <li>Return the pureed soup to the pot and add sour cream and reserved bacon pieces, stir well.</li>
        <li>Allow soup to simmer for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Top with additional sour cream, bacon, cheddar cheese, or chives. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
